This blog is currently hosting

- updates on my mathematical research;
- discussion of open problems;
- my notes on number theory, on algebra, and on algebraic geometry;
- and various other topics, usually related to mathematics.

I welcome comments from people with all kinds of mathematical backgrounds and levels of expertise; comments which are spam, self-promoting, off-topic, or otherwise not fulfilling the above requests will be summarily deleted; repeated offenders in this regard may be subject to blocking.  In particular, comments devoted primarily to promoting oneâ€™s own research are subject to deletion. Of course, I will not be able to personally respond to all the comments made on this blog.
